# SearchEngine

Using ncurses library I type a phrase or a word and depending on the search, some files from 'master.txt' show up as pages. I can scroll through them using keys up and down
and select them. They will be shown based on their html code and using 'b' I can go back to the previous page and select another file, or just try another search, either simple
or advanced. Pressing 'q' will leave the program.
